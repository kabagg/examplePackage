# Overview

The goal of this project is to...

The context and hypothesis...

Why we care (e.g., if true, this would mean we could treat 
patients better)

To address this, we have collected data on ?? samples
(how many?) using ?? assays (e.g., PCR, microarrays, etc)
along with associated metadata (e.g., which samples received
which treatment).
If the hypothesis is true, we expect to see ??, 
whereas we would expect to see ?? otherwise.

To test this, we will apply the following statistical
test(s), and look for...

Are there any sanity checks we know to apply _a priori_?
(E.g., if gene ABC doesn't change in response to treatment,
should we suspect something might be wrong with the experiment?)

# Brief Results

* [01_gather_data](results/01_gather_data.md) downloads the 
raw datasets used from the web.

# Running the Analysis

Roughly, our analyses involve running the R and Rmd files
in [R](R) in the order they appear. 

Run [R/95_make_clean.R](R/95_make_clean.R) to clear out any
downstream products.

Run [R/99_make_all.R](R/99_make_all.R) to re-run the analysis 
from beginning to end, including generating this README.

Raw data from the web is stored in [data](data).

Reports and interim results are stored in [results](results).

## Required Libraries

These analyses were performed in RStudio 
(insert version number here; this can be obtained in 
an interactive session with `RStudio.Version()$version`),
using `r version[["version.string"]]`, 
and use (in alphabetical order):

* here       `r packageVersion("here")`
* rmarkdown  `r packageVersion("rmarkdown")`
